  # Per to the following documentation:
  # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target
  #
  # The `pull_request_target` event runs in the context of the base of the pull request, rather
  # than in the context of the merge commit, as the `pull_request` event does. This prevents
  # execution of unsafe code from the head of the pull request that could alter the repository
  # or steal any secrets you use in your workflow. This event allows your workflow to do things
  # like label or comment on pull requests from forks.

  # Only automatically predict area labels when pull requests are first opened
